# Google-Indexing-API-Publisher
Python script designed to simplify the process of submitting URLs to Google's Indexing API for faster and more efficient website indexing. This tool is particularly useful for web developers, SEO professionals, and website owners who want to ensure that their website's content is quickly discovered and updated in Google's search results.

_**Must include Title "URL" in the box **[A1]** that is first row of first column. The indexing will not be completed without it.**_

**Features**
Easy-to-Use Interface: The script provides a user-friendly graphical interface built with tkinter, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

Batch URL Submission: You can submit multiple URLs for indexing at once by providing an Excel (XLSX) file containing a list of URLs.

JSON Key Authentication: Securely authenticate with Google's Indexing API using your service account JSON key file.

Detailed Feedback: The script offers detailed feedback on the indexing process, including successful submissions and any potential errors encountered during the process.

**Getting Started**
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed, which you can find in the requirements.txt file.

Set up a Google Service Account and obtain the JSON key file. Follow the instructions on Google's documentation for creating a Service Account and obtaining the key file.

Prepare an Excel file (.xlsx) containing a list of URLs that you want to submit for indexing. Make sure the file has a column named "URL" with the URLs you want to submit.

Run the script by executing the main.py file. The script will prompt you to select the JSON key file and the Excel file with the URLs.

The script will then process your request, submit the URLs to the Google Indexing API, and provide feedback on the indexing status.
